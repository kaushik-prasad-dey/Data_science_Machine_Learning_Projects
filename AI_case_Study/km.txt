=======STATS PROBLEM STATEMENT===========================
In india the average IQ is 100, with a standard deviation
of 15. what is the percentage of population would you expect to have
an IQ lower than 85 ?

 X is the IQ score (85)
 mean IQ (100)
 standard deviation is (15)
 so X=85, mean=100 and SD=15
 so the formula is:
 Z= 85-100/15=-15/15=-1
 z-score table -1 is : .1587
 now if we make its percentage : .1587*100=15.87%
