## Problem Statement
In this project we will be working on text dataset which is a book written by plato-The Republic. We preprocess the data into a more useable
format and then we will be building a NLP model that is trained on text dataset to highlighe the keywords from the text.The model creates features out of words to propose 
the important words which might highlight what the text data showcases or give you an insight about what might be the topic about. We will then
prepare our own website that will be build using the Django framework and host it on Azure.

TF-IDF(term frequency inverse document frequency) is a statistical measure that evalutes how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents. TF-IDF was invented
for document search and information retrieval. it works by incresing proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document but is 
offset by the number of documents that contain the word. So, the words that are common in every document, such as this, what, and if, rank low
even though they may appear many times, since they don't mean much to the document in particular.
